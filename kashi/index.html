				<h2>The History of BBC Broadcasting in Scotland, 1923-1983</h2>
				<p>"The British Broadcasting Corporation has always been at the forefront of radio and television programme making, and its regional organisation has been the inspiration for many independent stations throughout the world. In this, the first detailed history of BBC broadcasting in Scotland, Bill McDowell provides a comprehensive study of the corporation's development in one of the oldest and most autonomous of its regional centres. He traces its growth from the first local radio station in the 1920s right through until the early 1980s, when the BBC provided two network TV channels with Scottish opt-out programmes, a national radio channel, and numerous area and community radio stations and network radio services. Packed with statistical information and based on extensive original research, this is the standard history for all media and communication studies courses, and arts and media organisations."--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.
